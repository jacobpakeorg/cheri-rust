# This script is intended to be passed to `rustc` as the linker for our target.
# This is a temporary solution and not designed for use outside of CI.
#
# This script collects all of the object files provided as arguments and invokes
# the standard CHERIoT `xmake` build workflow, inserting the object paths to our
# compartments' `objectfiles` table.
#
# We use the `objectfiles` table as this will trigger a rebuild of our compartment
# when it differs between builds.
#
# We write/read these from a file `rust_objects.txt` because I couldn't find a
# saner way to communicate these to `xmake`.
